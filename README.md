# Project Odin

### Odin is an data platform for CCAs and LSEs that empowers electricity consumers with real time pricing data.

### Consumers can view real time price information at 5 minute intervals, as well as the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of the grid. 

### OdinAPI disseminates real-time price information so that developers can build automated "set it and forget it" energy technologies. These technologies can respond directly to the real-time energy price. This flexiblity helps customers save money on their energy bill, and helps CCAs and LSEs better maintain a clean, reliable grid.

Real time pricing data is retrieved from CAISO OASIS (Open Access Same-Time Information System): http://oasis.caiso.com/mrioasis/logon.do

GHG intensity data is retrieved from SGIP Signal: http://sgipsignal.com/

Technologies Used:
- Front End: React, Axios, APEX Chart
- Back End: FlaskAPI
